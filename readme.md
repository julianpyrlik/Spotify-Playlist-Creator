## About The Project

This script helps you create a Spotify playlist of Billboard Hot 100 songs for a specific year. It retrieves song titles by webscraping Billboard's website and then searches for those songs on Spotify, adding them to a new playlist.

## Built With

Python
Spotify API

## Getting Started


### Installation

1. Install the required libraries:

2. Create a Spotify app and obtain your client_id, client_secret, and redirect_uri. You can do this by following the instructions here: https://developer.spotify.com/

3. Create a file named .env in the same directory as your script and add your Spotify credentials.

How it Works

The script asks the user for the desired year.

It constructs a URL for the Billboard Hot 100 chart for that year.

It uses the requests library to fetch the webpage content.

It uses Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML and extract the song titles.

It authenticates with the Spotify API using your credentials stored in the .env file.

It searches for each song title on Spotify and retrieves the corresponding URI.

It creates a new private playlist on your Spotify account.

Finally, it adds the retrieved song URIs to the newly created playlist.
